                            <p>The SAE team at CBU was in need of an efficient way to modify vehicles for use in their simulator (Assetto Corsa).
                            My senior capstone team created a program written in Python that reworks the method of modifying vehicles in Assetto Corsa.
                            The program uses PySimpleGUI to create a GUI that the user can interact with and view all of the necessary 
                            vehicle data in one location. This program greatly cuts down the time it takes to modify vehicles in Assetto Corsa and provides 
                            functionality to convert an internal combustion vehicle to an eletric vehicle drivetrain and vice versa.</p>

                            and the textures of the map were verified in blender. </p>

                            of mine so for my Junior Design project my team made this web app. This web app allows a user to login or register an account with the database. 
                            From there the user can enter a vehicle's vin number in the search bar and the search engine will return the vehicle and the account registered 
                            that now owns that vehicle. The database grows by users using the web app and entering vin numbers of their vehicles. There is also a profile page 
                            that showcases the current vehicles that the user has or had.</p>

                            <p>This web app allows users to search the gamertag names of players with records in Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies. 
                            The leaderboard on the Call of Duty zombie modes are not accurate and filled with cheaters. At the time of this project there was 
                            one website out there that took submissions from players to keep track of the highest rounds achieved in zombies. 
                            However, this website lacked the feature to be able to search the name of a player and siaply all of the records that 
                            that player currently holds. My web app did just that and was a great way to compare how many records each player truly has.</p>

                    <p>Outside of programming, I am also a musician and a mechanic. When I was little I had lessons to play the drums 
                    for a year and then I continued on by teaching myself more and more. Eventually I wanted to learn more instruments 
                    so I learned how to play the guitar, bass, and I can read music. On top of that I enjoy recording and producing music.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Another big interest of mine is in cars. When I received my first car I wanted to learn more about cars 
                    and so I bought a project car that needed just about everything done to it. I threw myself in and learned how to fix cars 
                    and diagnose problems. From there I learned body work techniques and learned how to lay fiberglass down and smooth out body filler. 
                    Now I am learning how to paint cars and detail them. I enjoy all cars but specifically I enjoy Corvettes.</p>
